##Prototype\_\_Inheritance

- Prototypal inheritance is a core concept of javascript.
- Inheritance is one objet trying to access methods and properties of other object.

* **proto** is the object where javascript have all those hidden objects and methods which we are accessing automatically after typing . (dot operator)
* each an every object in javascript has a prototype
* so **proto** is an object also . so if we want to see this object prototype also it can be possible. we need to say object.**proto** and it will show us another object.
* now if we want to see what is the prototype of object.**proto** is, it is also possible. just say object.**proto**.**proto** and the result will be null.
